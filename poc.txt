After some researching through a personal pentesting, i've realized that i was able to enumerate valid / invalid e-mails through old, famous and "patched" Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync vulnerability disclosed by @grimhacker.

As we know, these kind of vulnerabilities are only possible because servers response delays, being possible to know if an user is valid or not through timing attacks.

At references below, you can see how those patched vulnerabilities was exploitated in the past, and how i took me several "minutes" to realize that now "patched" vulnerbility stay exploitable. I don't know if it was disclosure by someone in the past, but it worked very well on personal tests without microsoft domains.
